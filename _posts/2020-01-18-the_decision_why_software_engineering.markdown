At some point last year, I decided I wanted to code. I didnt really have a mind frame of why in the moment, but I did know where I wanted to go and that was Flatiron. I started there, did the research and joined the classes in September; hit some roadblocks and ended up transferring to a new cohort and ended up where we are right now: The Decision.

I made the decision eventually, even though, I already knew I *really* wanted to code. Â It was easy based on the reality of: you love computers, you love technology, you love art, why not take the leap and do something you've wanted to accomplish for quite some time now. So, I finally was able to just settle in my mind that this is what I really wanted, even if my heart had already decided for me. I also pulled a little inspiration from my late father. He always told me I could decide for myself what I wanted, that nobody could take my choices from me and that I shouldn't give up on my dreams regardless of what else was going on. My other dad would say, "Just do it today, tomorrow isn't promised." Of course, I procrastinated, but here we are. 

In the end, decided to become a software engineer was a mixture of heart, mind, and body. I knew I wanted to do it, it has become a *need* now. I love design, I love technology, and so this was the natural progression for me, in a journey of obstacles, tears, (sometimes a little blood and sweat) and mostly joy filled decision making. Overall, I'm excited to *finally* get started *again*. Cheers, Let's get started.
